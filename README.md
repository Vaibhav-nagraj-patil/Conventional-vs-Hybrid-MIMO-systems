# Conventional-vs-Hybrid-MIMO-systems
Iâ€™ve developed a simulation comparing the capacity of hybrid mmWave MIMO and conventional MIMO systems in MATLAB and Python. It evaluates performance across SNR values, highlighting the trade-off between capacity and hardware complexity. Hybrid MIMO, with fewer RF chains, offers a more efficient solution for high-frequency wireless communications.
